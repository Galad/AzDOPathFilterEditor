# Azure DevOps path filter editor
Chrome extension to view and edit path filters of branch policies easily

Path filters are a semicolon (`;`) separated list of paths. Editing long lists is not easy.
This extension adds a view / edit button in path filter inputs.

When clicked, it shows the path filters as a list of path where each line is a new path filter.
When Update is clicked, it updates the path filter by replace line breaks with semicolons.
